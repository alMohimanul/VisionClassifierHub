## Overview
This repository hosts the code implementation of a hybrid model designed to classify Bangladeshi Medicinal Plants. The model combines the power of deep learning techniques  to accurately classify various medicinal plants found in Bangladesh. This work proposed a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion and Attention-Guided Residual Network (MSFFAR-Net) that incorporates pre-trained MobileNetv2 as feature extractor and a series of newly introduced Attention Residual Convolution Module to classify Bangladeshi Medicinal plants. Our model, validated through a 4-fold cross-validation, achieved high classification mean accuracy of 98.12% for BDMediLeaves and 96.18% for the Bangladeshi Medicinal Plant Dataset.
